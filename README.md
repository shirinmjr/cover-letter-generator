# üåü **Dynamic Cover Letter Generator** üåü

<h3 style="color: #2E86C1;"><strong>‚ú® Generate personalized, high-quality PDF cover letters dynamically from a CSV file ‚ú®</strong></h3>

> **A program that leverages modern JavaScript tools to process CSV data and create dynamic PDF cover letters for each company in the list.**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used:**

- **JavaScript**: For data manipulation and scripting.
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **PDFKit**: To generate high-quality, customizable PDF documents.
- **File Reader/Writer (fs)**: For reading the input CSV and writing PDF files.

## üßê **Problem Context**:

At our company, we frequently need to generate dynamic PDF documents‚Äîsuch as reports, invoices, and cover letters‚Äîfor various clients. Customization, readability, and accuracy are crucial when creating these documents.

This project demonstrates how to generate PDF cover letters dynamically using the data from a CSV file and PDFKit. It replaces placeholder text in a predefined cover letter template with specific values from the provided CSV.

---

## üöÄ **How It Works**:

1. **Input Data**:

   - A CSV file containing company-specific details such as:
     - **Company Name**
     - **Address**
     - **City, State, Zip**
     - **Recipient Name**

2. **Cover Letter Template**:

   - The program uses a predefined template with placeholders such as `[Company Name]`, `[Address]`, and `[Name]` to inject personalized data.

3. **PDF Generation**:
   - Using **PDFKit**, the program dynamically generates high-quality PDF documents for each company with the provided data.

## üìë **Steps to Implement**:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Setup MVP Project**:

- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install pdfkit
  ```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Process CSV Data**:

- Read and parse the CSV file using pre built JavaScript File System Library and `readFileSync` function.
- Extract relevant fields from CSV file
  - Split by line and remove empty rows - perhaps the end of the file,
  - First row is the headers(JSON keys),
  - Split row by commas and replace "" where Job title not provided with empty string,
- Map each header to its corresponding value (Key,value) pair

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate PDF**:

- Use [`PDFKit`](https://pdfkit.org/) to:
  - Write text content.
  - Replace placeholders with actual values.
  - Style the document (fonts, colors, margins, etc.).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Save PDFs**:

- Save the generated PDFs to an `output/` directory.
